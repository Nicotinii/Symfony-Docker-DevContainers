My project involves using Symfony and Docker with Dev Containers. 
It helps me create a customized development environment for my Symfony application.   
With Docker, I can package and deploy my application consistently. 
Dev Containers simplifies dependency management and streamlines the development process. Together, Symfony, Docker, and Dev Containers enhance my workflow and ensure seamless application deployment.





## Installation
### Docker not install
If Docker is not already installed, follow these links to install it:

For [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/): Please refer to the instructions specific to [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).  
For [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/): Please refer to the instructions specific to [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).  
For [Macos](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/):  Please refer to the instructions specific to [Macos](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

### Docker installed

Clone the repository of your choice and using the following command:

```bash
git clone "url"
```

#### Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

Download the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension by Microsoft and the [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) extension if you haven't already.

#### After installing the extensions
Press ```F1``` in VSCode and select "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Dev Container" from the dropdown menu.

Let the magic happen as the dev container is set up for you.

Please note that these instructions assume a basic familiarity with using Git, Docker, and Visual Studio Code.
